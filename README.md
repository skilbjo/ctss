# compatible time-sharing system

## What
The Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS), was one of the first time-sharing operating
systems; it was developed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Computation Center.
CTSS was first demonstrated in 1961, and was operated at MIT until 1973.

## Influences
Multics, which was also developed by Project MAC, was started in the 1960s as a
successor to CTSS â€“ and in turn inspired the development of Unix in 1969. One of
technical terms inherited by these systems from CTSS is daemon.
